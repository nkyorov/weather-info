# Meteorological analysis

> Java program that analyzes meteorological data, collected over a number of years from weather stations around the UK. Uses simplified versions of several datasets taken from https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-historic/#?tab=climateHistoric

• Extracts data from a csv file
• Produces output regarding the largest magnitude earthquake such as location, time, longitude, latitude, magnitude and depth
• Extracts data from USGS data resource and produces similar output as the offline counterpart
• The program will try to extract data from the USGS page, however if connection is unsuccessful local file will be used. The output would also inform the user whether the data is acquired locally or online
